## INTRODUCTION
Sorting data is one of the basic steps while handling a large amount of data in order to produce effective results and observing assembly languages, they have no way to provide that functionality.

## HYPOTHESIS
With the help of the Irvine 32 library, it is possible for us to create such a library which would help in sorting our data with different sorting algorithms which vary depending on the task the user wants to accomplish.

## ALGORITHMS

* SelectionSort
* HeapSort
* MergeSort
* Gnome_sort
* Insertion_sort
* BubbleSort
* CocktailSort
* ShellSort
